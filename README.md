# XharkTank
The backend of XharkTank where budding entrepreneurs can pitch ideas for a business or product they wish to develop by providing their name, title &amp; idea for the business, the investment amount they expect to be fulfilled, and the percentage of equity they are ready to shed away to the potential investors. 

## Objective
SharkTank is a panel of potential investors, termed as "Sharks", who listen to entrepreneurs pitch ideas for a business or product they wish to develop. These self-made multi-millionaires judge the business concepts and products pitched and then decide whether to invest their own money to help market and mentor each contestant.
We will be building a backend of XharkTank where budding entrepreneurs can pitch ideas for a business or product they wish to develop by providing their name, title & idea for the business, the investment amount they expect to be fulfilled, and the percentage of equity they are ready to shed away to the potential investors. Investors must be able to retrieve the list of all pitches and share their feedback/comments with a counter offer as per their interests. We will be implementing the GET/POST APIs required for the backend to function as per the requirements.
